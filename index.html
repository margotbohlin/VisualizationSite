        <h1>COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Race/Ethnicity: Current Data and Changes Over Time</h1>
        <p>This story has been remixed with visualizations created by Margot Bohlin. Here is the <a href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/covid-19-cases-and-deaths-by-race-ethnicity-current-data-and-changes-over-time/">link</a> to the original story.</p>
        <p>Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, analyses of federal, state, and local data have shown that people of color have experienced a disproportionate burden of cases and deaths. Disparities in infections and deaths have both widened and narrowed at various times over the course of the pandemic, with disparities generally widening during periods in which the virus has surged and narrowing when overall infection rates fall. In data that has not been adjusted for age, there were some periods when death rates for White people were higher than or similar to some groups of color. However, in the age-adjusted data, White people have lower death rates than AIAN, Black, and Hispanic people over most of the course of the pandemic and disparities are larger for AIAN, Black, and Hispanic people, reflecting an older White population and higher rates of death across all age groups among people of color compared to White people.</p>
        <p>Age-standardized data show that that NHOPI, Hispanic, and AIAN people are at about one and a half times greater risk of COVID-19 infection than White people, and AIAN, Hispanic, NHOPI, and Black people are about twice as likely to die from COVID-19 as their White counterparts</p>

        <p>Analysis of monthly data on COVID-19 infections from CDC and deaths from NCHS shows disparities in infections and deaths have both widened and narrowed over the course of the pandemic. During periods in which the virus has surged, disparities have generally widened, while they have narrowed when overall infection rates fall. However, over the course of the pandemic, specific patterns of disparities have varied by race and ethnicity and between cases and deaths.</p>

        <p>The disproportionate amount of cases and deaths comes down to  disparities in health coverage across groups. It is imperative that healthcare systems work to improve health equity and accessibility. Society must ensure that every individual has equal access to quality healthcare, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. </p>
